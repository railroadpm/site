  Cars On Line is the average of the daily on-line inventory of freight cars. Articulated cars are counted as a single unit.
  Cars on private tracks (e.g., at a customer's facility) are counted on the last railroad on which they were located.
  Maintenance of way cars are excluded.

  Cars on Line figures are reported by car type and by car ownership:
